# E-commerce Back End (ORM)

## Description
This is an example back end for an e-commerce application. Database models were added to existing code along with API routes to each table, primarily done uing Node.js, MySQL, and Sequelize. Insomnia is used to test routes to ensure models, routes, and database seeds are functional.

## Usage
Application requires Node.js. Run the command 

    npm init 

after cloning the repo to install npm packages and dependencies. 
You may need to run the command 

    npm i express dotenv mysql2 sequelize 

to install all packages manually. 

Add a .env file at the root directory and add DB_NAME, DB_USER, and DB_PW to match the database's name and your MySQL credentials, respectively.
